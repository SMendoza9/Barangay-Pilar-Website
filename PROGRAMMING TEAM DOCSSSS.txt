APPLICANT-VIEW (FORMS)
- Capitalize the “guide or example” thing that is shown per field
- Automatically capitalize all the information inputted, so you may remove the “ USE CAPITAL LETTERS WHEN FILLING OUT THIS FORM” at the top of the form.
- Make everything required to be answered unless specified that it isn’t required.
- Make it so that only letters can be put in fields that require only words (example: name)
- Make it so that only numbers can be put in fields that require only numbers (example: age)
- Make it so that every field is required to be filled out
- Contact Number must be in this format “09xx xxx xxxx” and must be 11 digits only. It should automatically format starting with the “09” and so on.
- Automatically input the age after inputting the date of birth (if both are required)
- The purpose of the application should be in drop-down (that you can search for it, like when you type letters and that the most related would appear), wherein when you choose a requirement, fields where you can input the needed information would appear. And that you can choose multiple purposes in the drop-down list and that fields would appear requiring all the needed information for the purposes that the applicant chose. But some information shouldn’t be redundant, meaning if a field has already appeared before, it shouldn’t repeat again (for example, the applicant wants to get both documents A and B, after choosing both from the drop-down, fields would appear that require information for both documents (but of course separate them), and if something like “age” was already required to be answered for document A, it shouldn’t appear again under the required information under document B since the applicant has already answered that before. But make it so that even though the applicant only answered the question once (under document A), the information inputted would still appear on the PDF for document B (the automated PDF won’t be done right now since it isn’t that “step” yet though).
